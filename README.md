# Butt Cast

Welcome!

This page will be updated as the project goes along ~


## Purpose

This project has three main purposes: 

1. Make a cool app which enables people to async communicate with each other building on the distributed communication protocol SSB

2. Serve as a way for me to learn how to code and build SSB apps

3. Help others with learning how to build apps by making a guide that even a beginner (such as myself) can follow based on the latest (09.02.22) tech in the SSB ecosystem utilizing metafeeds and room. 

This project would not have been possible if not for the support of [@arj](https://github.com/arj03) and [@mix](https://github.com/mixmix) who are guiding me. Many thanks 🙏🌸

## The App 

The idea of the app is an asynchronous conversation app. The general design is in process so here is a visualization in the meantime:

## The Guide

### Step 0 - Setting up the base

#### Installing stuff
Here we will present some of the building blocks needed to build an SSB app:

##### Install Electron
- Install [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) 
- API base in insomnia
- Enables us to package the application

##### Install Insomia 

- API base in [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download
)
- Enables us to build in the "normal flow" of building applications
- Splits out the front end from the back-end. Enables two groups to work on it, front end(browser based) and back-end (insomnia).

Check Insomnia_scripts.json for examples

It is also possible to build directly in the browser yet that will not part of this guide.

#### Best practices 
- Have commit history 
- Commit tidy bundles

### Step 1 - Building the app backend (optional order) (Anders, showing how it can be used in front-end)

- Make test with back-end and front end

- Using metafeeds (one ID but multiple "Main Feeds")

#### Storing data locally 
- Done, not documented

#### Fetching local data
- Done, not documented 

#### Sharing of the Data (through rooms and pubs)

### Step 2 (building the UX (Paul + Eileen) )
- Build the UX

### Step 3 - Bundle in Electron (André for electron)
- Bundle in electron

### Step 4 - Make an installer and distributing app 
- Publish
